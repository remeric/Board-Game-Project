# Board Game Project Purpose: Growing in Knowledge

The purpose of this project is to track my experience and knowledge in DevOps, as I look to move my career from my 15 years as a systems administrator/engineer more torwards a DevOps or Platform Engineer.  On September 8th, 2021 I had no practical experience in programming, DevOps, Python, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, as well as other various tools.  After two weeks of learning I implemented my first running projects in AWS, and will continue to improve upon it as I game more knowledge and learn more tools.

## Board Game App Synopsis

To build an application using modern DevOps tools that will eventually implement Ci/CD methodology.  The application itself will be a tool that will allow users to choose from available board games to play based on certain parameters such as number of plays present, and amount of time available to play.

## Branches

Please see my various branches to check out other implementations of the application, such as the EKS_Build branch that utilizes Kubernetes on Amazon EKS behind a load balancer.  The branches are to show my experience but the main applicaiton I plan to run in free tier services to save on personal cost.

## Tools/languages I have started implementing to date

Python
Flask
