# Board-Game-Project
My first ever project, creating an app that will recommend board games to a group of gamers based on certain parameters such as number of players, time to play, game ownership, etc.

The Purpose of this project:

I am an IT professional with mostly Sys Admin experience in an on premise Windows environment - in an effort to try and move into a DevOps role I am creating a project to track my progress in my knowledge, one that will start small and improve more and more.  Eventually I would like to put it in a container, create pipe lines for uploading code, automate as much of it as possible, and make it more into a CI/CD project.  To this end I am also starting to dig into Docker, Terraform, Jenkins, Kubernetes, etc.
